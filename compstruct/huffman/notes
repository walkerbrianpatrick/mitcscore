Huffman's Algorithm

Given a set of symbols and their probabilities, this algorithm generates an 
optimal variable length encoder. So, a cool demonstration of this algorithm 
would be to take a text, generate its optimal variable length encoder, 
and encode/decode that text. The value of the algorithm is demonstrated by 
comparing the size of the original text file to a file which contains the 
encoded data. 

The huffman tree problem has a few main components:

1. analyze a text to determine the probability of a symbol
2. ability to construct a tree according to huffman's algorithm
3. using said tree to encode the text
4. decoding the data using the tree
5. observing the size of the data before and after encoding

To make this a useful tool, a procedure for including the encoder as a 
serialized object along with the data and a way to recover that encoder 
should be developed
