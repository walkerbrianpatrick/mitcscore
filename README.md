# mitcscore
Implementations of datastructures, algorithms and systems discussed in the
MIT core computer science curriculum. The project structure uses the maven
conventions, and test driven design is employed during module development. 

The intent is to implement each topic from java primitives if possible,
failing that to use core language features. Failing that, there will be a period
of weeping and gnashing of teeth, followed by the employ a library of sufficient
facility and stability.
